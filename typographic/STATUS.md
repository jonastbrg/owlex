## Current Focus

Visual text adversarial attacks on vision-language models. OCR-based injection methods.

## Progress

| Component | Progress | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Basic perturbations | 40% | Active |
| Transferability testing | 20% | Planning |

## Recent Progress

- Basic typographic perturbation methods implemented
- Placeholder for visual text attack analysis

## Key Decisions

- Focus on robustness testing scenarios

## Blockers / Risks

- None currently

## Next Steps

1. Expand attack variants
2. Measure transferability
3. Document findings
